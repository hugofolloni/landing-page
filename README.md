# landing-page
## ðŸ“– About the project
This is a project that I made while learning React, right before start creating my own portfolio website. It's an "under construction" landing page with input field (made with React) and a database/backend (made with Node.js).

## ðŸ§” User Story
It's a landing page, that user can see an "under construction" notice. Also, he can see an input field, that is for email address, and it's how we can notify when the website is  ready. When he sends his email address, it is added by POST method on a database, with all emails that was received. When the website is ready, the admin can run the backend, made with nodemailer, sending to all of the addresses the wanted message.
